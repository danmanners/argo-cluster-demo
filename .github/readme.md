# Deploy Kubernetes in AWS using Talos Linux backed by ArgoCD

This repository is an opinionated way to deploy Kubernetes in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) and [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd).

## Critical Notes

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in the _very_ early stages of development and is not ready for production use. Please use at your own risk!

## 👋 Introduction

This project aims to serve as an opinioned but practical starting point for deploying cloud resources using [Infrastructure-as-Code](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac) (**IaC**), Kubernetes in AWS using [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) (_**not**_ AWS EKS), and [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) using [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd). I want to enable those interested to learn how to go from zero to operational, so I will attempt to explain everything in detail as you navigate through this repository! I hope this serves as a useful learning tool for you, dear reader, as well as a practical starting point for deploying your own Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.

As best I can, links to other resources that I have found useful in my personal learning journey and references to any technology utilized by this project will be provided.

## ✨ Features

- Automated and Immutable Deployment of Kubernetes in AWS
- ArgoCD for GitOps and declarative service management
- Encrypted Secrets in your Git Repo using [Bitnami-Labs/Sealed-Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)

...and more!
